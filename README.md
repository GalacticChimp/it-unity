## Background

This is a fork of Josh Coppola's [Iron Testament](https://github.com/joshcoppola/it) repository, original description:

> This is a hobby project where I explore procedural generation, emergent economies, and goal-based AI

Related forum thread: [Iron Testament](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=121634.0)

The original README.md was moved to the legacy folder.

## Goals

Create an interesting and diverse world with some simulation elements, give AI actors unique motivations and behaviors, and allow the player to experience a story formed from these elements

But the next step is to migrate all of the python code to Unity/C# 

## Features
* Procedural generation of world, cities, languages, and creatures
* Emergent economy formed from traders gathering resources, trading in local markets, and bringing resources between markets
* AI actors which can learn and spread knowledge of events, locations, and other actors

## Dependencies
The new project only requires Unity 6000.0.25f1

The original project requires Python and the following packages:
* pyYaml
* pattern
* matplotlib

## Operating systems
Currently only works for Windows machines.
